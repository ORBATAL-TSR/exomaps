# 04 — Astrophysical Modeling & Inference

## Modeling Philosophy
Use observations as the hard anchor, then fill gaps with constrained probabilistic models that remain transparent and reversible.

## Entity Confidence Tiers
- **Observed-Confirmed**: high-confidence published detections.
- **Observed-Candidate**: unconfirmed, with source-level confidence.
- **Inferred**: generated by rule/model from partial observations.
- **Simulated-Decorative**: optional low-priority detail for gameplay ambience.

## Planet Inference Concepts
- Estimate plausible planet count by stellar class + metallicity priors.
- Place candidate orbital lanes using spacing heuristics.
- Respect known planet exclusion zones to avoid overlap.
- Assign rough mass/radius/type distributions from empirical priors.
- Optionally infer habitable-zone occupancy probabilities.

## Belt Inference Concepts
- Infer inner rocky belts in systems with architecture analogs.
- Infer outer icy belts beyond giant-planet regions where plausible.
- Size/width mass proxies tied to star mass and system age estimates.

## Orbital Plausibility Checks
- Reject unstable overlap and resonance conflicts by heuristic rules.
- Apply conservative eccentricity caps where data is absent.
- Ensure generated systems remain interpretable and consistent.

## Simulation Coupling Outputs
Each inferred object should include:
- Physical estimate fields.
- Stability score.
- Resource potential score (for game economy).
- Exploration priority score (for colonization planning).

## Model Versioning
- Every inference run tied to `inference_model_version` and random seed.
- Preserve previous inference outcomes for comparison.
- Support deterministic rerun for debugging and balancing.

## Future Advanced Modeling
- Bayesian model updates as new data arrives.
- Optional lightweight N-body spot checks for key systems.
- Active-learning queue for human review of uncertain regions.
