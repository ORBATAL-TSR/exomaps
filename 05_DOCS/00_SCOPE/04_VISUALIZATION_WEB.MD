# 06 — Web Visualization Plan

## Purpose
Provide an analytical command-map for understanding astrophysical context and steering civilization simulation outcomes.

## Primary Views
- **Galaxy Neighborhood View**: stars, systems, routes, political overlays.
- **System Detail View**: star, planets, belts, colony/economy markers.
- **Timeline View**: key events and trend charts.

## Layer Controls
- Observed vs candidate vs inferred planets.
- Political regions/influence fields.
- Economic lanes and freight intensity.
- Exploration front and unsettled opportunities.

## Interaction Model
- Click system -> detail panel.
- Compare two systems side-by-side.
- Filter by confidence tier and strategic relevance.
- Time scrub + pause + fast-forward.

## Data API Needs
- Spatial chunks for viewport-aware loading.
- Aggregation endpoints for heatmaps and trend analytics.
- Snapshot + incremental update protocol.

## UX Constraints
- Clarity over visual noise.
- Explicit confidence cues.
- Fast access to provenance (where did this object come from?).
- Minimal friction for scenario control.

## Milestone Deliverables
- MVP: static snapshot map + system drill-down.
- V2: live simulation controls + political/economic layers.
- V3: comparative analytics and scenario branch explorer.
