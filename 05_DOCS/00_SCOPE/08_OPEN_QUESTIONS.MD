# 11 — Open Questions & Research Backlog

## Astronomy & Data Questions
- Which primary catalog(s) become canonical for nearby-star distances?
- How to prioritize conflicting planetary parameters across sources?
- What confidence threshold admits unconfirmed planets into strategic simulation?

## Modeling Questions
- Which inference methods balance plausibility and computation cost best?
- How to calibrate generated system richness without overfitting Solar analog assumptions?
- What minimum orbital model is sufficient for gameplay without pseudo-precision?

## Simulation Questions
- What travel model best captures SFTL hardship while remaining playable?
- How complex should economy chains be for emergent behavior before they become opaque?
- Which political abstractions produce readable and meaningful maps?

## Product Questions
- What is the core player fantasy: planner, ruler, explorer, or systems analyst?
- How much direct control vs high-level policy steering should the player have?
- Which metrics define a successful campaign outcome?

## Engineering Questions
- Best partition between precomputed snapshots and live updates?
- How to maintain deterministic replay across engine versions?
- What profiling regime is needed before game-client-scale rendering?

## Immediate Next Research Tasks
1. Evaluate coordinate conversion libraries and establish reference conventions.
2. Draft cross-match policy for star/planet identity resolution.
3. Prototype inference on a small benchmark set of nearby systems.
4. Define simulation time-step and event granularity experiments.
5. Specify API contracts for web client MVP map + controls.
